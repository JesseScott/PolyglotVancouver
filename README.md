# PolyglotVancouver

data analysis and visualization of the 2017 Polyglot Vancouver Un-Conference


### Motivation

During the very first session that I attended on May 27th, 2017, one particular person immediately started driving the conversation.
Extremely opinionated, confrontational, and dismissive of alternative opinions, people immediately started to check out both mentally and physically.
I could see how much it was affecting the experience that myself and others had paid for and invested in, and I was angry.

### Strategy

But rather than confront directly, I decided to bear witness instead, which may have been the wrong decision, but it is a time honoured one.
On a hunch, I started a markdown file that tracked how many times each person spoke.

### Documentation

Aside from the amount of time(s) that someone spoke, I decided to track their gender (which, as you may guess, was a seemingly large factor in how comfortable they were in deciding to speak), as well as whether they arrived on time and/or stayed until the end (which I took to assume that the micro-politics of the room were unpalatable ).
