# PolyglotVancouver

This repository holds a project conducting data analysis and visualization of the 2017 Polyglot Vancouver Un-Conference.



### Motivation

During the very first session that I attended on May 27th, 2017, one particular person immediately started driving the conversation.
Extremely opinionated, confrontational, and dismissive of alternative opinions, people immediately started to check out both mentally and physically.
I could see how much it was affecting the experience that myself and others had paid for and invested in, and I was angry.

### Strategy

But rather than confront directly, I decided to bear witness instead, which may have been the wrong decision, but it is a time honoured one.
On a hunch, I started a markdown file that tracked how many times each person spoke.
The initial results were interesting, so I maintained the strategy for the rest of the sessions that I attended that day.

### Documentation

Aside from the amount of time(s) that someone spoke, I decided to track their gender (which, as you may guess, was a seemingly large factor in how comfortable they were in deciding to speak), as well as whether they arrived on time and/or stayed until the end (which I took to assume that the micro-politics of the room were unpalatable ).

### Analysis

Conducting rudimentary data science methodologies upon the dataset, I attempt to visualize the extent of disparity in the amount of public voice that certain persons and certain demographics were granted or able to affect.

### Files

 * README.md --> this file
 * Polyglot Session Notes.md --> the original notes that I took during the sessions
 * polygot.ipynb --> Interactive Python (Jupyter) Notebook where I perform the primary data analysis
